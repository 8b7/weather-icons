# Weather Icons
*Version 2.0 - August 2015*

## A free, open source icon-font of Weather icons

Weather Icons is the only icon font and CSS with 215 weather themed icons, ready to be dropped right into [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), or any project that needs high quality weather, maritime, and meteorological based icons!

Inspired by [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), they work in essentially the same way. They are infinitley scalable and any CSS that can be applied to text can be applied to them. All you need to do to insert an icon is add the base class and the specific icon class to an "i" element, like this:

``<i class="wi wi-day-lightning"></i>``

## Getting Started
Getting started is easy. First, add the weather-icons.css to your project. Second, put the font files in a `font` directory on the same level as your `css` directory. By default, the fonts are referencing a ../font/ folder that is on the same level as /css. This can be changed via the `wi-path` variable in `weather-icons-core.less/scss`.

#### CSS Only Method
If you just want to add a css file to your project with no Less compiling, you just need to reference the `weather-icons.css` included in the css folder.

## New in version 1.3


### Collaboration
If you feel so inclined to add icon ideas, icon art, or other fixes/changes to how the package works, feel free to help! I'd also love it if someone wanted to make this a component as well for bower, npm, component, etc. No idea how to do that myself (yet).

## Credit
The icon designs are originally by [Lukas Bischoff](http://www.twitter.com/artill). Icon art for v1.1 forward, HTML, Less, and CSS are by [me (Erik)](http://www.helloerik.com).

None of this would be  possible without [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Lukas Bischoff](http://www.twitter.com/artill). I just put it all together into a neat package. Cheatsheet provided by Michael Woywod.

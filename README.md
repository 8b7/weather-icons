# Weather Icons
*Version 2.0 - August 2015*

## 215 Weather Themed Icons and CSS

Weather Icons is the only icon font and CSS with 215 weather themed icons, ready to be dropped right into [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), or any project that needs high quality weather, maritime, and meteorological based icons!

Get started at [http://weathericons.io](http://weathericons.io)!



### Collaboration
If you feel so inclined to add icon ideas, icon art, or other fixes/changes to how the package works, feel free to help! I'd also love it if someone wanted to make this a component as well for bower, npm, component, etc. No idea how to do that myself (yet).

## Credit
The icon designs are originally by [Lukas Bischoff](http://www.twitter.com/artill). Icon art for v1.1 forward, HTML, Less, and CSS are by [me (Erik)](http://www.helloerik.com).

None of this would be  possible without [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Lukas Bischoff](http://www.twitter.com/artill). I just put it all together into a neat package. Cheatsheet provided by Michael Woywod.
